Mathesko
========

Mathesko (\məˈthēsko\\) is a portmanteau of the ancient greek words `mathesis` and `methusko`. 
`Mathesis` means the *serious acquisition of knowledge*. 
`Methusko` means *to become intoxicated*. The compound `mathesko` is intended to connote `drunk with knowledge`. 
One implication in the domain of wine is obvious, as is perhaps the allusion in the realm of academics. 
I most like, though, the double entrende arising from the translation to English: wine that is *drunk with knowledge*.
The purpose of this application is to help us all learn about the incredibly complex topic of wine so that we may
drink it with shared knowledge, which is always preferable to drinking alone in the dark.
