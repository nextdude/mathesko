Mathesko
========

Mathesko is a portmanteau of the greek words `mathesis` and `methusko`. 
`Mathesis` means the serious acquisition of knowledge. 
`Mathusko` means to become intoxicated. The compound `mathesko` thus means `drunk with knowledge`. 
One implication in the domain of wine is obvious, as is perhaps the allusion in the realm of academics. 
I most like, though, the double entrende arising from the translation to English: wine that is *drunk with knowledge*.
The purpose of this application is to help us all learn about the incredibly complex topic of wine so that you may
drink it with knowledge.
